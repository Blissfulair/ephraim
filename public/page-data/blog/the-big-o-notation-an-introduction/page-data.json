It&#8217;s a character from one of my favourite movies &#8220;Home&#8221; and his name is Oh. Oh like Big &#8220;Oh&#8221; notation. Get it ðŸ˜‚? Let us get serious now.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A long time ago, before the emergence of 10x engineers, software engineers sought ways to solve real-world problems with their programming skills. Different engineers came up with different solutions/algorithms to solve these problems. There was a need to compare these solutions based on their complexity and efficiency. This need gave birth to the Big O notation. What is the Big O notation then?</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>What is the Big O notation?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Big O notation is used in computer science to describe the performance or complexity of an algorithm.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Algorithms are to computer programs what recipes are to dishes. Different recipes can help you to make a particular meal but they don&#8217;t always yield the same results. They don&#8217;t always have the same steps, ingredients nor take the same amount of time to follow. Some recipes are faster and produce better results than others.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the same way, different algorithms can achieve a particular computer program. However, they are not all equally efficient or take the same amount of time to run. We use Big O to measure the efficiency of an algorithm.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, let&#8217;s consider sorting. There are many sorting algorithms e.g. mergeSort, bubble sort, quicksort, and insertion sort. How do you know which is more efficient or less complex? This is why the Big O notation exists.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You might wonder, why do we need a notation? Why don&#8217;t we just consider the time it takes to run the algorithm? Here are two of many reasons:</p>\n\n\n\n<ol><li>Different computers have different processors and thus some computers will spend less time running an algorithm than others.</li><li>Some programming languages are faster than others.</li></ol>\n\n\n\n<p>It will be stressful taking all these factors into consideration when trying to analyze an algorithm. Rather than do that, the Big O notation uses something more standard &#8211; the input. It considers how the runtime of the algorithm grows in relation to the size of the input. It is also good to note that the Big O notation considers the worst-case scenario for its analysis.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hopefully, you get the sense of it now. Next question that might come to your mind is &#8220;Why should I know this?&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>The Why?</h3>\n\n\n\n<ol><li>For a small app that processes little data, such analysis might be unnecessary. This is because the difference in the runtime of algorithms might have little impact on your app. For large applications that manipulate a large amount of data, this analysis is crucial. Because inefficient algorithms will create a significant impact on the processing time. With a good knowledge of Big-O notation, you can design algorithms for efficiency. Thus, you&#8217;ll build apps that scale and save yourself a lot of potential headaches.</li><li>For your coding interviews. Yeah, you heard me right. You are likely to get asked by an interviewer the runtime complexity of your solution. So it&#8217;s good to have an understanding of the Big O notation.</li></ol>\n\n\n\n<p>Let look at some common examples of Big O Notation</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Common Runtime complexities</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https://thepracticaldev.s3.amazonaws.com/i/r38ytuycnzi6hd8dnevh.png\" alt=\"\"/></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Source: https://www.bigocheatsheet.com</p>\n","date":"October 09, 2019","author":{"name":"admin"},"featured_media":null},"site":{"id":"Site","siteMetadata":{"title":"The Hon.
