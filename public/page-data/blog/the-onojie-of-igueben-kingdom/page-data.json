The Onogie’s New Year Festival &#8211; Ihuan, which is\nsimilar to the Ukpe Festival also affords further opportunity to\nengage with local traditional practices. There are potentials for\ntourists attractions such as historical landmarks like the Onogie&#8217;s\npalace and rainforest expeditions. These opportunities are yet to be\nexploited. \n</p>\n\n\n\n<p>References\t</p>\n\n\n\n<ol><li>\n\n\t&#8220;Post\n\tOffices- with map of LGA&#8221;. NIPOST.
