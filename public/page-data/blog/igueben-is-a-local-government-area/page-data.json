The Headquarters is in the ancient town of Igueben.\nIgueben has an area of 380 km² and a population of 69,639 according\nto the 2006 census. The post code is 310.  \n</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>History</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>According\nto available history culled from Wikipedia, Igueben was founded\naround 1516, during the reign of the Benin monarch, Oba Esigie\n(1504–1550), who was one of the warrior kings of the great kingdom.\n\n</p>\n\n\n\n<p>War\nhad broken out between the Kingdom of Benin and the Attah of the\nIgala Kingdom based at Idah, a town on the banks of the Niger River.\nOba Esigie sent warriors in pursuit of men from Idah who had invaded\nBenin City. The Igala kingdom subsequently had to pay a yearly\ntribute to the Oba for this transgression. \n</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On\ntheir way to Idah, these warriors camped at a spot for a number of\ndays before setting out on the final leg. Some months later when they\nhad successfully accomplished their mission, they were returning home\nwhen they passed the same camp spot again. Whilst resting there, they\nfound that the remains of the yams they fed on during their outward\njourney had germinated and blossomed. Searching for food and water,\nthey found lots of succulent fruit and vegetables as well as many\nanimals to hunt. The water from the springs also tasted good. They\nwere very impressed with the fertility of the soil in this area. \n</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A\nfurther survey of the place showed that the landscape was flat and\nhad no rocks or mountains; this they thought would be good for\nfarming. There were lots of palm, coconut, rubber and walnut trees\ntogether with a variety of fruit like mango, orange, lime, guava,\nlemon, grape, pineapple, cashew, tomatoes, avocado pear, wild\nberries, peppers, okra, melon, pumpkin, banana, and plantain. There\nwere also a wide variety of vegetables like water-leaf which grew\neasily and quickly. They found that tubular root crops like yams,\ncassava and sweet potatoes germinated and matured quickly. \n</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They\nknew that news of the discovery of this fertile land would please the\nking and decided that instead of going back to Benin, they would\nsettle on the land and send their taxes back to him in the form of\nfarm produce instead. They sent an emissary to the king of Benin to\nobtain permission to set up a new settlement in the area, ensuring\nthat the king saw the advantages of a rich harvest and more crop\ntaxes. After much deliberation, he granted them permission to settle\nand live there. \n</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To\nreward these soldiers for their effort and retain their loyalty, the\nking granted them the patent to engage in bronze casting for added\ntrade; so they joined the Benin Royal Guild of Bronze Casters as the\nonly ones outside of Benin City allowed to engage in bronze casting\nin the kingdom. (Anyone else caught doing this was put to death or\nbanished from the kingdom, his family disgraced for ever). \n</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The\nnew settlers perfected their craft of bronze casting and the\nproduction of the royal pestal[check spelling] called Eben. They cast\nand sent the Oba an Eben each year to show their gratitude and\nloyalty for this benevolence; this was accompanied by products from\ntheir harvest. \n</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The\nsettlers later named the place Igue-Eben which means a village or\ncamp for producing Eben; and so Igueben was born. The little\nsettlement soon started to grow, particularly with the influx of\ntraders from Benin city. They did business with distant lands toward\nthe north eastern axis from Benin city. Its trade with other areas\nbegan to thrive and it became prosperous. \n</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>The\nArea Today</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The\nvillage is governed by a traditional ruler called Onogie. The present\nOnogie is HRM Ehizogie Eluojerior. He, along with his council of\nchiefs and prominent traditional rulers, maintain law and order in an\never-changing westernized world. This governance system is the same\nas is used in the current monarchy of Benin and has been in existence\nsince the earliest times in Benin&#8217;s history. \n</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The\nindigenous people of Igueben are very hard working, creative,\nindustrious and fun-loving. They are a very literate population with\nmost families educated to university level. They continue to maintain\ntheir cultural heritage from Benin, celebrating many festivals and\nritualistic traditions. \n</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Their\nlanguage is a unique dialect of Edo and Esan. They also use Pidgin\nEnglish, which is a mixture of Portuguese, English and Esan. The\nmajority speak very good English due to their high levels of\neducation. \n</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Today,\nIgueben is endowed with numerous sons and daughters in various\nprofessions e.g. doctors, lawyers, barristers, bank directors,\nbusinessmen and women, writers, poets, teachers, engineers,\nscientists, architects, nurses, technicians, politicians, advertising\nand marketing professionals, farmers and some self-made millionaires.\n\n</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Igueben\nconsists of several towns whose suburbs conurbate seamlessly. Some of\nthe popular towns are: Eguare, Oyomo, Afuda, Idumeka, Idumonka, Uhe,\nEgbiki, Ekekhen Idigun, Idumogbo, Idumedo, Idumotutu and Idumogo. A\nwoman’s town origin may be determined by the manner in which she\ngreets her elders in the early morning; for example: &#8216;Latuse&#8217;,\n&#8216;Lamogun, &#8216;Lagiesan&#8217;, &#8216;Lani&#8217;, &#8216;Labheze&#8217; are peculiar to Uhe, Idigun,\nIdumonka, Idumeka and Afuda/ Ekekhen respectively. \n</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The\npeople of Igueben are very sociable, showing deep respect for other\ncultures; this is particularly evident in their ability to marry\nfreely into other tribes and cultures from both within and outside\nNigeria. They also possess deep sense of fidelity and social\nresponsibility. \n</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Facilities</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Major\nfacilities include the Igueben General Hospital, the Igueben Grammar\nSchool, the Igueben College, the Igueben Mixed Secondary School, the\nCollege of Education Igueben, the Union Bank of Nigeria PLC, the Uda\nCommunity Bank PLC, numerous primary schools, two major markets and a\nLocal Government Council Secretariat. Its rainforest remains largely\nuntouched. \n</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Economy</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Igueben\nhas a growing economy. The indigenes engage in retail trade of\nmanufactured goods which they buy from major cities like Port\nHarcourt, Onitsha, Lagos, Sapele and Benin City. Goods traded include\nbuilding materials, clothing, electronics, mechanical spare parts\netc. \n</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The\nprimary occupation in Igueben is farming. Local produce are cross\ntraded with Northern parts of Nigeria; they sell food products\npeculiar to the savannah vegetation such as tubular roots like yam,\ncassava (garri), banana and plantain etc. and buy produce peculiar to\narid areas such as beans, onions, groundnuts, potatoes etc. Foreign\nexport includes palm produce, rubber and timber. \n</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Igueben\nis highly affected by urban migration as young and educated sons and\ndaughter migrate to larger cities and abroad for more lucrative job\nopportunities. The many celebrations and festivals throughout the\nyear provide occupation for many locals e.g. in advertising,\ncatering, costume making, cultural dance and events organisation. \n</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Tourists\nattractions</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cultural\ncelebrations like the Ukpe Festival showcasing masquerades,\ntraditional dances, family entertainment and visits; are well worth\nexperiencing. The Onogie’s New Year Festival &#8211; Ihuan, which is\nsimilar to the Ukpe Festival also affords further opportunity to\nengage with local traditional practices. There are potentials for\ntourists attractions such as historical landmarks like the Onogie&#8217;s\npalace and rainforest expeditions. These opportunities are yet to be\nexploited. \n</p>\n\n\n\n<p>References\t</p>\n\n\n\n<ol><li>\n\n\t&#8220;Post\n\tOffices- with map of LGA&#8221;. NIPOST.
